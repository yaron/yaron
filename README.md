### Hello!

## Current work
I'm currently working on a wishlist application for my family. There's a backend written in Go and a frontend written with Svelte (JS). It also includes an image hosting part that fetches an image and returns the location of the saved version.

## Presentations
I've made some trainings that are best viewed on github.io instead of in their repositories:
