### Hello!

## Current work
I'm currently working on a wishlist application for my family. There's a backend written in Go and a frontend written with Svelte (JS). I'm planning on updating the flutter application I wrote for an older version to also work with the backend and to add a File-proxy app in Go that can cache the images.

## Presentations
I've made some trainings that are best viewed on github.io instead of in their repositories:
